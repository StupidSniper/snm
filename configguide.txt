[ HOW TO CONFIGURE SNM ]

file path defaults to $HOME/.config/snm/snm.conf, you can set custom paths with the -f flag

There are only 5 things to configure, 
[time]
start_hour = // this should be in HHMM format (ex. 2100 for 9:00pm)
end_hour = // same story as start_hour
transition_time = // the amount of time it takes to transition from daytime settings to night. HHMMM format again

[main]
shift = // between 1 and 0, 1 is daytime settings, 0 is full gamma shift
brightness = // again, between 1 - 0. 0 is completely off, 1 is daytime
